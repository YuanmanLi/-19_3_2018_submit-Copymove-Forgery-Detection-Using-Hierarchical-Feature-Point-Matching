1. We have recomplied the vl_feat libary for adaption, which is also included our source code.  
2. The result of each run could be slightly different due to the randomness involved. 
3. all the pictures shown in our (journal) paper can be repoduced by running the script 'runDemo.m'

We test the results based on the current code (windows7 && matlab2013b): 
       TPR          FPR
F220:  100%,      1.82%
F600:  97.50%     5.68%
GRIP:  100%,      0%
FAU:   100%,      2.08%
